Hello all!

My name is Ben. I'm a senior at Brigham Young University, where I am obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with an emphasis in Data Science. I love learning, and I'm always trying to synthesize the best of what I learn into solutions.

I am preparing to graduate in December, and am looking for full-time software development positions starting in January. I thrive in collaborative environments and I have work experience in frontend development. I also have experience in iOS development using Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI, and I have experience developing for blockchain technologies. Feel free to reach out regarding any positions you might be hiring for.
