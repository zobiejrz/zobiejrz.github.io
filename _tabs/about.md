Hello all!

My name is Ben. I'm a recent graduate from Brigham Young University, where I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with an emphasis in Data Science. I love learning, and I'm always trying to synthesize the best of what I learn into solutions.

I’m a software engineer who loves turning ideas into polished apps. My experience spans frontend development, iOS apps using Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI, and blockchain projects. I thrive in collaborative teams and am currently looking for full-time roles. Let’s connect if you’re hiring or just want to chat about building software!
